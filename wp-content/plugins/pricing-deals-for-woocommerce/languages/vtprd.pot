"Membership is used within Wordpress to control access and capabilities, when "
"a role is given to a user.  \r\n"
"                 Wordpress assigns certain roles by default such as "
"Subscriber for new users or Administrator for the site's owner. Roles can "
"also be used to associate a user \r\n"
"                 with a pricing level.  Use a role management plugin like "
"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-role-editor/ to establish custom "
"roles, which you can give \r\n"
"                 to a user or class of users.  Then you can associate that "
"role with a Pricing Deals Rule.  \r\n"
"                 So when the user logs into your site, their Role interacts "
"with the appropriate Rule."
