				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The military significance of sea power evolved rapidly after modern navies changed from sailing ships to ships that were powered by steam and other fuels. This seminar will focus on the naval aspects of modern warfare, with particular attention to the changing ideas about sea power in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, the battleship race of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the development of submarines, aircraft carriers and new naval strategies in the two world wars, and the new uses of naval forces after World War II. Our guides for this analysis of sea power will be outstanding UNC historians Gerhard Weinberg and Joe Caddell, both of whom have written and taught about the importance of new technologies in the history of warfare. Join us for a careful exploration of how sea power has influenced modern international conflicts, national identities, and military strategies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In Collaboration with Carteret Community College</em></p>
<p>This seminar will feature two scholars exploring one of the great cultural contributions of the South: our music!</p>
<p>UNC Professor of Music Jocelyn Neal will present<strong> Song of the South:  Assimilation and Secession in Today’s Country and Bluegrass Music</strong><br />
The musical heritage and present day musical practices of the American South are a treasure trove for exploring how Southern culture interfaces with mainstream American popular culture.  We will look at bluegrass and country in the present to consider how those musics balance assimilation with the constant tension to separate themselves as distinct genres and traditions, and how those impulses are part of a long tradition.</p>
<p>Kenan Distinguished Professor of English and Creative Writing, Bland Simpson, will present <em> </em><strong>A Sound Country Serenade: Words &amp; Music from King Mackerel and Other Works.  </strong>Bland Simpson has collaborated on a dozen musicians&#8217; theatre shows and has written a number of lyrical books about coastal and sound country North Carolina, work that has overlapped most noticeably in the popular musical <em>King Mackerel &amp; The Blues Are Running:  Songs &amp; Stories of the Carolina Coast.  </em>He will discuss and perform songs from this and other shows and read from his books as well.</p>
<p>Tuition: Lecture &amp; Lunch, featuring a four-course meal at the CCC Culinary Cafe on campus, $40. Lectures Only: $25</p>

<p><em>In collaboration with the Institute for the Study of the Americas</em></p>
<p>Global economic and cultural changes have profoundly affected indigenous cultures throughout the Americas, but these changes have also given indigenous people new reasons to reaffirm their cultural identities as they resist globalizing social forces.
